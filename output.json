Tried reformatting to addDecorator in global config, as well as directed locally to individual stories. Link to migration guide: https: //github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/5.0.0/addons/info
Nothing worked. Need instructor or heavier guns in on this one. If this issue is fixed, lessons 6-9 should work properly with updated dependencies. 
Lessons 1-5 worked just fine.
