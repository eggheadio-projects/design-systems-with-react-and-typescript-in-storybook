# Changelog

All notable changes to "Design Systems with React and Typescript in Storybook” will be documented in this file. 

## 1.0.0
-  Course needs major review for lessons 06-09. Could not resolve issues. 
-  Deprecation for lessons 06-09: 
    "Error message: Passing stories directly into withInfo() is deprecated, instead use addDecorator(withInfo) and pass options with the 'info' parameter. Followed by: TypeError: Cannot read property 'parameters' of undefined. Tried reformatting to addDecorator in global config, as well as directed locally to individual stories. Link to migration guide: https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/5.0.0/addons/info. Nothing worked. Need instructor or heavier guns in on this one. If this issue is fixed, lessons 6-9 should work properly with updated dependencies. 
- Lessons 1-5 worked just fine. "
